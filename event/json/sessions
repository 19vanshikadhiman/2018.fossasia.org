Interns are paid a stipend of $5,500 and have a $500 travel stipend available to them.

LDAP is a standard application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an Internet Protocol (IP) network. I am helping Fedora improve the Directory Servers Python command line tools. In addition to this, the team at Fedora is also investigating into integrating existing C code with Rust (watch here: </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: underline;\">Integrating Rust with existing C</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\">) to improve performance and maintainability.

My first task was to add the command line support for automember plugin to the Directory Server. Automembership allows a static group to act like a dynamic group, for adding new members to the group. Different automembership definitions create searches that are automatically run on all new directory entries. The automembership rules search for and identify matching entries and then explicitly add those entries as members to the group. I started by added the classes (Auto Membership Plugin, Auto Member Definition, Auto Member Definitions), methods and the tests for these classes and methods (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: underline;\">Pull Request</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\">). Then I added the support for automember by command line which included creating, removing, editing and showing the automember definitions. This included writing the tests as well. By the end of this task, I learnt about Python decorators, lazy evaluation in Python, using pytest testing tool and writing command line parser and arguments using the argparse library. (This will be shown with live coding and screenshots).</span></p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\"></span></p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\">I am currently working on another task which involves building an LRU cache in Rust which stores C allocated strings and can retrieve them. This project will be built using the meson build system. I will also provide tests and asan builds. This task will act as a proof of concept for investigating if meson can replace autotools as the Directory Server build system. During this task, I hope to learn about build systems, LRU caching concept and Rust types and safety.</span></p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\"></span></p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\">As you can deduce from my tasks and the key learnings, doing this Outreachy internship with Fedora is helping me to stand at the forefront of technology, learning about LDAP, Python and Rust (polyglot!), which will definitely enable me to become a better programmer and a collaborative community member for Fedora.

worked on implementing collaborative editing using Operational Transformation algorithm with Typeset in my summers internship 2017. <p>There are various papers on both the methods of implementing collaborative editing : <strong>Operational Transformation</strong>, which goes back to 1989, when it was first implemented by the GROVE (GRoup Outtie Viewing Editor) system (this algorithm is quite old, and Google uses this algorithm for collaborative editing for Google Docs, Google Slides, Wave, etc) and <strong>Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types</strong>, which is a much newer approach to real-time editing.</p><p></p>Real challenge of collaborative editing<p></p><p>If you know how real-time collaborative editing works, then you may know that handling concurrent editing in multi-user environment gracefully is very challenging. However, a few simple concepts can simplify this problem. The main challenge, as mentioned, with collaborative editing is the concurrency control [<strong>concurrent edits</strong>] to the document are not commutative. This needs to be causally ordered before applying either by undoing history or by transforming the operations [<strong>operational transformation</strong>] before applying them to make them seem commutative.</p><p></p>Bringing Latency into action<p></p><p>Introducing latency between the client and server is where the problems arise. Latency in a <span>collaborative</span> editor introduces the possibility of version conflicts. Here, where, I said Operational Transformation will come into action.</p><p></p><p>Let’s take an example :</p><p></p><p><strong>Starting Client’s state :</strong></p><p></p><p>ABCD</p><p></p><p><strong>Starting Server’s state :</strong></p><p></p><p>ABCD</p><p></p><p>Now, let’s say, <em>Client</em> enters X in between C and D , the operation would look something like this :</p><p></p><p>insert(X,3) //where 3 is the position where x is going to be added (0=A, 1=B, 2=C ..)</p><p></p><p>And at the same time, <em>Server</em> deletes,b the operation would be :</p><p></p><p>delete(B,1)</p><p></p><p>What actually should happen is that the client and server should both end with ACXD but in reality, <em>client</em> ends with ACXD</p><p></p>Starting Document State -&gt; ABCD\"Insert 'X'\" operation at offset 3 [local] -&gt; ABCXD\"Delete 'B'\" operation at offset 1 [remote] -&gt; ACXD<p></p><p>but the <em>server</em> ends with acdx.</p><p></p>Starting Document State -&gt; ABCD\"Delete 'B'\" operation at offset 1 [local] -&gt; ACD\"Insert 'X'\" operation at offset 3 [remote] -&gt; ACDX<p></p><p>Of course, ACXD != ACDX and the document which is shared now is in the wrong state.</p><p></p><p>Here is where the <strong>Operational Transformation</strong> algorithm comes to the rescue.</p><p></p>Operational Transformation Algorithm<p></p><p>Operational Transformation (OT) is an algorithm/technique for the transformation of operations such that they can be applied to documents whose states have diverged, bringing them both back to the same state.</p><p></p>How does Operational Transformation work?<p></p><p>A short overview of how OT works :</p><p></p><ul><li>Every change (insertion or deletion) is represented as an <strong>operation</strong>. An operation can be applied to the current document which results into a new document state.</li><li>To handle concurrent operations, we use the <strong>tranform</strong> function that takes two operations that have been applied to the same document state (but on different clients) and computes a new operation that can be applied after the second operation and that preserves the first operation’s intended change.</li></ul><p></p><p>Let’s apply Operational Transformation in the original example.</p><p></p><p>If we apply OT, <em>Client</em> will see :</p><p></p>Starting Document State -&gt; ABCD\"Insert 'X'\" operation at offset 3 [local] -&gt; ABCXD\"Delete 'B'\" operation at offset 1 [transformed] -&gt; ACXD<p></p><p>and <em>Server</em> will see :</p><p></p>Starting Document State -&gt; ABCD\"Delete 'B'\" operation at offset 1 [local] -&gt; ACD\"Insert 'X'\" operation at offset 2 [transformed] -&gt; ACXD //Transform function would add add it in the new (3 - 1 = 2) position<p></p>Client — Server [OT] Approach to Collaborative Editing<p>The <strong>transform</strong> function is used to build a client-server protocol that can handle collaboration between any number of clients.</p><p>Choosing a Client-Server architecture will allow scouting a large number of clients without actually complicating the environment. Also, there will be a single system which holds the source of truth i.e. the server, so even if the clients crash/go offline for a long time, we can go back to the server and fetch the document easily.</p><p>This source of truth also forces the client to wait for the server to <strong>acknowledge</strong> the operation that the client has just sent which would mean that the client always stays on the server’s OT path. This would help in keeping a single history of operations without actually having to keep a mirror of the state for each client that is connected. That would eventually mean the number of clients that are connected to the server would have only one single copy of the document on the server.</p><p></p>Conclusion<p></p><p><strong>Operational Transformation</strong>\n is a very powerful tool that allows to build great collaborative apps \nwith support for non-blocking concurrent editing. I am looking forward \nto dive deep into the algorithm (and ofcourse extending this blogpost) \nand possibly working on an editor which supports it as well.</p><p></p>","signup-url":null,"starts-at":"2018-03-25T14:30:00+00:00","average-rating":null,"language":null,"video-url":null,"slides-url":null,"is-mail-sent":false,"title":"Building a real-time collaborative editor using OT","comments":null,"is-locked":false,"id":"4508","track":{"name":"Web and Mobile","description":null,"deleted-at":null,"font-color":"#000000","color":"#f5eb00","id":"934"},"microlocation":{"name":"Training room 4-2","floor":4,"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"deleted-at":null,"room":null,"id":"627"},"session-type":{"name":"Talk","deleted-at":null,"length":"00:25","id":"380"},"speakers":[{"email":"srijan@wikitolearn.org","speaking-experience":"<p>1.

The operation mode can be used on non/synchronous LTE satellite station, and satellite communication authentication with IMSI code for IoT cubic satellite. If the LTE signal is accessible, and authorized to talk, the data will be sent through. The LTE ground station will be the gateway, and downlink to the ground.

Now, imagine the possibilities that can exist if we were to we combine the worlds of Virtual Reality and Internet of Things This session will enable people with minimal knowledge of VR and basic IoT boards(such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi) to experience the best of the IoT &amp; VR worlds. </p><p></p><p>Furthermore, attendees will experience a remote tele-robotic presence as they transport and assume the identity of a web-connected robot, tasked with monitoring and maintaining atmospheric conditions.</p><p></p><p> Along with the view of the place, the robot will be monitoring the nearby surroundings such as temperature, humidity and light intensity which will be then displayed along with the scenario displayed by VR device. Thus by this audience will learn how to Combine IoT with VR and hence make their own smart telepresence system like Jarvis.</p><p></p><p> </p><p>By the end of the session, the audience will gain an increased understanding of the VR and IoT landscape, as well as how these technologies can be combined to give them an experience in life that was previously never-before-possible. A short Q&amp;A session will be held after the [talk/workshop].</p><p></p>","signup-url":null,"starts-at":"2018-03-25T16:00:00+00:00","average-rating":null,"language":null,"video-url":"https://youtube.com/watch?v=xWvQEqdJ1JA&list=PLzZVLecTsGpKb1P8J5WLrONMLby5Dn1EV&index=156&t=0s","slides-url":null,"is-mail-sent":false,"title":"When VR meets Internet of things: Life beyond second life","comments":"<p>Session details1.Without demoa.

GPU computing provides the opportunity to parallelize data parallel algorithms while CPU can run the sequential code. With increasing algorithmic development, some new algorithms require iterations of parallel computation on the GPUs (computation scale larger than GPU memory) while some require multiple different data parallel algorithms to run simultaneously, which are notorious to be managed by the programmer.</p><p></p><p>HPX is an open-source, general purpose C++ library for developing parallel and distributed applications with a broad community usage. This talk aims to discuss the development of HPX Compute language (HPXCL) API for the integration of GPU computation with asynchronous many task execution library HPX. Asynchronous functions are provided for kernel launch, kernel execution and data transfer with the capability to hide the communication latency through computation. To give an example, computation on multiple CPU nodes, GPU nodes can all occur in parallel and can be synchronized when the results are required by the user. This system unleashes the potential to take computation to the exa-scale level.</p><p>This development is currently spearheaded by the Stellar Group Community which is a consortium of global researchers.

At the same time, these same organizations have struggled to leverage FOSS in an effort to make their work more participatory, sustainable, and effective.</p><p>Mainstream software often used in wealthier markets do not always fully meet the specialized needs of international development projects and the areas in which those projects are undertaken. Other fields have demonstrated the FOSS development model as a proven viable model to leverage global collaboration to share costs across institutions, increase the quality of products, and more rapidly innovate.</p><p>In the international development community, the results have been mixed. Relatively few of these FOSS projects have endured &amp; matured — when successful, enabling improved and sustained access to information and services that previously were out of reach for marginalized populations. Many efforts have failed, often due to preventable reasons.</p><p>These FOSS digital development projects usually struggle with lack of long-term investments in key focal areas such as community effectiveness &amp; product development. Without emphasis of these key considerations, they can rarely match the functionality and quality of their proprietary competitors. As a result, these FOSS projects can’t grow to the more advanced levels of maturity needed for widespread adoption throughout the development field.</p><p>In collaboration with partners around the world, the Digital Impact Alliance (DIAL) at the United Nations Foundation is launching its Open Source Center, a multilateral participatory program designed to be a global focal point of FOSS digital development projects. In this talk, you’ll learn:</p><p>1.

The Cython compiler translates Python code to C or C++ code, and supports static type annotations to allow direct use of C/C++ data types and functions. You get the best of both worlds while working with Cython: Python like syntax with blazing fast C speed. This talk/tutorial by a Python/Cython developer introduces Cython programming language and leads the participants all the way from their first Python extension to an efficient integration with native C. Topics covered will be: 1. Using the Cython compiler to build a native extension module 2. Cython development from Jupyter notebook 3. Mixing Python with static C types in the Cython language 4. Calling into native code from Cython code (Brief introduction) 5. Wrap up: A brief case study Cyvlfeat: A Cython/Python wrapper for Computer Vision library, VLFeat. Participants are expected to have a good understanding of the Python language, some basic knowledge about C or C++. No deep C programming knowledge is required, nor is any prior knowledge needed about writing extension modules for the CPython runtime.</i></p>","signup-url":null,"starts-at":"2018-03-22T12:00:00+00:00","average-rating":null,"language":null,"video-url":null,"slides-url":"https://github.com/simmimourya1/pycon_india_17","is-mail-sent":false,"title":"Scientific computing using Cython: Best of both Worlds!

What do you do when you have a systems team of 10 devs and a company of more than 250 devs (and growing)?  Automate every task in an extensible and scalable way. At Go-Jek, we were seeing requests being raised at rates of more than 15 adhoc tasks per week. We decided to bring it down to less than 3 per week.The requests received by systems team belonged to 7 broad categories. For instance, requests included tasks like setting up services, increasing disk size, fixing master-slave db replication, etc. Most tasks can be handled by users themselves. Hence we decided to build `Proctor` to help us automate repetitive and manual tasks.We had 3 requirements:- Users should be able to automate any job (in any language of their preference)- Handle requests of running a job in a sandbox environment and report its status- Have a simple and documented interface to run a jobThe design we took ended up with 3 components independent of each other. The components are as follows:1. `Automation scripts reservoir`- A user adds a script( in any language, having any dependency)- Review every script by security- Package script and dependencies into an image during CI; and push it to internal artifactory2. `Service to handle jobs`- A web service which handles submission and reporting of jobs- Authorization is handled by this service- This service runs jobs in relevant kubernetes cluster- All configuration and secrets required by a job (inside packaged image) are managed by this service3. `Client to run jobs`- A client (CLI tool) to run jobs using the web service- All parameters required by the job are managed by the clientAs an end result, users can automate any task, manage its configuration in the server and run it using the client.This talk will revolve around how the design of `Proctor` evolved over time with feedback from users; challenges faced; what impact it had on Go-Jek; and the future of `Proctor` (hint: we're open sourcing it soon).</p>","is-locked":false,"id":"4397","track":{"name":"Cloud, Container, DevOps","description":null,"deleted-at":null,"font-color":"#ffffff","color":"#e83700","id":"704"},"microlocation":{"name":"Event Hall 1-1","floor":1,"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"deleted-at":null,"room":null,"id":"639"},"session-type":{"name":"Talk","deleted-at":null,"length":"00:25","id":"380"},"speakers":[{"email":"roy.peter@go-jek.com","speaking-experience":null,"complex-field-values":null,"heard-from":null,"city":null,"position":"Systems Engineer","short-biography":"<p>Roy is currently working as a Systems Engineer at GO-JEK.

Mind mapping is\none of the popular learning techniques employed by the academic fraternity all over\nthe globe. This technique is utilized to improve the academic performance of\nthe students for understanding subjects and laboratory too. This is because of the clear representation of the technical concepts in systematic way through mapping. This kind of learning helps students to correlate among the technical concepts without ambiguity. Though it seems to be simple it's impact is powerful as it works on cognition of Human beings. Instead of\nfreehand drawing to create mind maps, open source software tools are employed. The merits of the usage of open source software are being able to create many such mind maps in short\nduration, edit them at any time, able to add attractive colors and patterns to create interest and gain attention of students, design in numerous ways to develop creativity and so on. Of the majority of the methods employed, this teaching - learning technique has gained prominent importance among students. The result of this work is found to be amazing among all the students for both theory subjects and practicals.\nThere has been phenomenon change in understanding the technical concepts and\nanalyzing

Compared to proprietary softwares used for communication, Free RTC uses open standards making voice and video chat communication truly secure. Specifically, Lumicall (<a href=\"http://lumicall.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">lumicall.org</a>) is a tool which makes phone calls over the internet, free of charge and with end-to-end encryption, so there is no man-in-the-middle. Compared to other free software solutions like Ring or Jitsi: it uses SIP, Session Initiation Protocol. Now SIP has great advantages over other protocols used in telephony, for example it’s Interoperability with many other telephony solutions. Using free software for real time communication makes it possible to make and receive calls from people who choose only to use genuinely free software &amp; open standards preserving the credible standard of privacy. This choice to choose free and secure software over proprietary software is hard but essential at this point of time where almost everyday new softwares are coming up to achieve communication.</span></p><p><span style=\"\"></span></p><p><span style=\"\">Both us as students have been part of Google Summer of Code and Outreachy program with Debian.

For a long time most Jabber service providers were run by volunteers with a few 'big players' attracting the majority of the users. Big Players however have the potential of taking away a lot of the benefits of federated networks. How can we do a better job at giving users more flexibility in their choice of service provider?</p><p>We run a for-profit Jabber service provider with the ability to bring your own domain. Bringing your own domain - in theory - gives users the ability to  switch freely between different providers. This talk is not only about the challenges we faced but also about our motivation to be one of the first to offer such a service. Why did we decide to be a for profit service even though most Jabber providers were free? How can we become a profitable business but don’t give up the true spirit of federalisation by becoming a centralized entity?</p><p>While this talk uses Jabber/XMPP as an example a lot of the conclusions can be applied to other federated communication protocols like Matrix or - to a degree - Email.</p><p></p>","signup-url":null,"starts-at":"2018-03-22T12:00:00+00:00","average-rating":null,"language":null,"video-url":null,"slides-url":null,"is-mail-sent":false,"title":"Being a service provider in a federated network","comments":"<p>If accepted it would be good if this talk could be scheduled after the Jabber/XMPP talk.

These commands will have an effect. Functional languages like Haskell, OCaml revolve around the concept of 'pure functions'. A pure function is expressed as a mathematical expression only. You can evaluate the expression and there will be no side effects, for example, no I/O operations, no global state changes, no database interactions. The output is only dependent on its inputs. Hence, it is based on ‘equational reasoning’. So if you were to call a pure function with the same inputs a million times, you would get the same result every single time. Since there are no side effects, there is immutable data.</p><p>The data once initialized remains same throughout the lifetime of the code, which makes 'parallel programming' easier. Due to this immutability of data, the value of an expression is the same anywhere it might occur in the program – as long as the required variables are defined. This is termed as 'Referential Transparency'. It means that the value of an expression is the same anywhere it might occur in the program – as long as the required variables are defined. You never need to track the value of state variables or remember any updates. This enables usage of 'memoization' – you basically ‘remember’ the outputs of expensive functions with some common arguments in a sort of lookup table. This reduces the computational complexity at the expense of memory.</p><p>Functions are dealt as 'first-class citizens', i.e, you can treat them as any other objects – you can assign them to variables, you can pass them as arguments, or even get them returned from other functions. 'Recursion' is the most important aspect of functional programming, since there are no loops (which prevents any side effects). 'Higher order functions' like map(), reduce() and filter() can take functions as arguments (or return them as results), providing parallelism over sequences. Partial function application, 'currying' and 'lazy evaluation' prevents loading entire data at once into the memory. All these features provide the advantage of code re-usability, less bugs, easy testing and parallelism. </p><p>This talk will acquaint the audience with functional programming features and why is it a hot topic today.</p><p>Last 5 minutes would be left for any questions.</p>","signup-url":null,"starts-at":"2018-03-24T13:30:00+00:00","average-rating":null,"language":null,"video-url":null,"slides-url":null,"is-mail-sent":false,"title":"Thinking functionally: Introduction to Functional Programming Paradigm","comments":null,"is-locked":false,"id":"4473","track":{"name":"Web and Mobile","description":null,"deleted-at":null,"font-color":"#000000","color":"#f5eb00","id":"934"},"microlocation":{"name":"Training room 2-2","floor":2,"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"deleted-at":null,"room":null,"id":"515"},"session-type":{"name":"Talk","deleted-at":null,"length":"00:25","id":"380"},"speakers":[{"email":"anejaalisha37@gmail.com","speaking-experience":"<p>I have given talks in local meetups like Pyladies and MLAI meetup.

This not only required building a wide variety of deep learning algorithms to account for natural language variations but also fairly complex in-house training data creation exercises.</p><p>A big part of any deep learning based product is data. Algorithms v/s Data debate has transformed into a contentious one off late. But general consensus has been biased towards voluminous quality data over deep layered networks. Especially in NLP, people are ready to give an arm and leg to get their hands on quality data. That was a very early realization that our team had when we were starting off the planning phases for the NLP engine.</p><p>We have been working on creating a scalable NLP engine for scalable information extraction from medical discharge summaries. What makes the problem statement even more difficult is the lack of quality training data as well as the wide domain expertise needed to succeed in this use-case. So, we focused on building solid and scalable data collection pipelines before building algorithms. And so, we did. </p><p>We have been generating in-house training Data in a peer-reviewed 3 level QA system. Our models have to ingest annotated data for better performance, so it was important to ensure quality. Now, the issue was, the training data itself being Patient Healthcare Information (PHI) which makes it trickier if we are to be HIPPA compliant. We also had to make sure that the data being annotated in encrypted and no patient information is accessible to external parties to ensure HIPPA compliance.</p><p>We architected and deployed a secure &amp; scalable cloud platform for data collection plus annotation using Open Source tools like Brat and Docker. We deployed the solution on AWS using VPCs, load balancers, EFS and S3. Now, we have crossed 20K annotated training data samples, which is a treasure mine for our data-hungry algorithms.</p><p>The talk will focus on digging deeper into the problem statement above, as well as explaining some of the constraints that go into building a deep learning based clinical decision support system while remaining on the fair side of legal and business guidelines. We will majorly talk about our learnings in building annotation pipelines for training data creation and deep learning frameworks specifically from a point of view of Clinical Named Entity Recognition systems.</p>","signup-url":null,"starts-at":null,"average-rating":null,"language":null,"video-url":"https://youtu.be/_7h8B_tV0wQ","slides-url":null,"is-mail-sent":false,"title":"Building a decentralized data collection platform for Deep Learning in Healthcare","comments":"","is-locked":false,"id":"6220","microlocation":null,"track":{"name":"Artificial Intelligence ","description":null,"deleted-at":null,"font-color":"#ffffff","color":"#1565C0","id":"1502"},"session-type":{"name":"Talk","deleted-at":null,"length":"00:25","id":"380"},"speakers":[{"email":"manasrkar.nmims@gmail.com","speaking-experience":"<p>I have been/will be a speaker at the following major conferences;</p><p>- Pycon India, 2016</p><p>- Multiple PyData Meetups, 2016</p><p>- RootConf by HasGeek, 2017</p><p>- Strata by OReilly, London, 2018</p><p>- AI Conf by Oreilly, New York, 2018</p>","complex-field-values":null,"heard-from":null,"city":"Mumbai","position":"Senior Manager","short-biography":"<p><span style=\"\">I am currently leading the NLP &amp; Data Science practice at Episource, a US healthcare company.

It becomes critical to examine if and how the governments hosting this restrictive global policy-making space may engage citizens through their online presence—host country conference outreach websites. The chapter explores relational underpinnings between states and citizens in such websites by examining the values privileged by designers using mixed methods. Among UNCCC websites from 2007 to 2009, the Danish government website's enhanced features may have contributed to potential inclusivity for the inter-governmental process online compared to previous government's efforts. However, findings have shown such interactive website's inherent design aspects may potentially shape the manner that climate conversations are limited in an assumed democratized space online. </span></p><span style=\"\"></span>","signup-url":null,"starts-at":"2018-03-22T12:00:00+00:00","average-rating":null,"language":null,"video-url":null,"slides-url":null,"is-mail-sent":false,"title":"Democratic potential of UN Climate Change Conference Host Government Websites?","comments":null,"is-locked":false,"id":"4486","microlocation":null,"track":{"name":"Open Data, Internet Society, Community","description":null,"deleted-at":null,"font-color":"#ffffff","color":"#0050eb","id":"708"},"session-type":{"name":"Talk","deleted-at":null,"length":"00:25","id":"380"},"speakers":[{"email":"cathy.candano@gmail.com","speaking-experience":"<p></p>","complex-field-values":null,"heard-from":null,"city":null,"position":null,"short-biography":"<p>Catherine Candano is based in Singapore and focused on the interaction user experience, new media technologies and environmental sustainability.

Comparing to the traditional VM or the recent containers, Unikernels are smaller, more secure and efficient, making them ideal for cloud environments. There are already lots of open source projects like OSv, Rumprun and so on. But why these existing unikernels have yet to gain large popularity broadly? We think Unikernels are facing three major challenges: 1. Compatibility with existing applications; 2. Lack of production support (e.g. monitoring, debugging, logging); 3. Lack of compelling use case; 4. Lack of standard to Unikernels. In my presentation, I will review our investigations and exploration of if-how we can convert Linux as Unikernel to eliminate these significant shortcomings, where I name this as UniLinux, and some potential but valuable use cases to Unikernels like IoT, Serverless and IO-intensive applications.</p>","signup-url":null,"starts-at":"2018-03-23T16:30:00+00:00","average-rating":null,"language":null,"video-url":"https://youtu.be/4XIThgGLUNY","slides-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/temp/f2a3784a-13a1-49f6-9493-d99848e360c4/c2x6SS94ZE/Unikernelized_Real_Time_Linux__IoT_TiejunChen_RT-Summit.pdf","is-mail-sent":false,"title":"UniLinux -- Unikernelized Linux","comments":"<p>I'm not sure if this is very much \"Kernel &amp; Platform\", and it's probably related to \"Cloud &amp; DevOps\".</p><p>If I can get 40 minutes, things couldn't be better.

This work was done during a research internship at CSIR-National Institute of Oceanography. We worked with datasets provided by the field work and underwater explorations in the Arabian Sea along Western Coast of India. In this project, the traditional image restoration approach is extended by incorporating underwater optical properties into the system response function. Underwater turbidity causes loss of clarity transparency, visibility and the luminosity in underwater images to study a particular scene for Marine Archeologists. In this project, we have implemented and compared different methods of underwater image enhancement and restoration which are degraded by the turbidity in water. We implemented the various image processing algorithms considering an average quality camera (i.e., Logitech C920). The algorithms implemented in a step-wise manner are preprocessing, filtering, enhancement and denoising based on a model. Images tend to get degraded as the depth and turbidity increases, the amount of light on objects decreases and light distribution becomes nonuniform. To tackle this issue, the input images are converted to YCbCr color space and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) is performed on the Luminescence(Y) channel of the image which improves the local contrast, at the same time limiting the amplification which can over-amplify the noise too. The filtering and enhancement were done using the Bilateral Filter and then finally the enhancement was carried out using the wavelet denoising method and de-blurring. Due to the intensity variations involved in underwater sensing, denoising is carefully carried out by wavelet decompositions. This is necessary to explore different effects of restoration constraints, and especially their response to an underwater environment where the effects of scattering can be easily treated as either signal or noise.</p><p>Since our solution aided the marine archeologists in their studies, we gave more emphasis to the information extraction and the visibility of features rather than the enhancing the physical features of the underwater images.</p>","signup-url":null,"starts-at":"2018-03-25T13:30:00+00:00","average-rating":null,"language":null,"video-url":"https://youtube.com/watch?v=LbWDTnI_3Do&list=PLzZVLecTsGpKb1P8J5WLrONMLby5Dn1EV&index=185&t=0s","slides-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/temp/4449dc67-323b-4d1a-a6e0-48a26f221244/OWdYMGJveU/FossAsia18_Proposal.pptx","is-mail-sent":false,"title":"Reducing the effect of turbidity in underwater images","comments":"<p>This proposal is our joint work - Mr. Himanshu Singh and myself.

The beauty of games is that we can visually inspect the output as the AI agent plays it - we will step through the logic of deep reinforcement learning, the “train of thoughts” of the AI agent and how we can code all these up in Tensorflow and Python with just our laptop or a small cloud cluster.</p><p>Why now? Well, AI used to be a privilege of the rich, crazy or both. Thankfully, we now have the maturity of open source technologies, availability of data science knowledge and affordable hardware for hobbyists like us to craft our own AI agents. An understanding of AI is necessary because what’s next is either the beginning of the greatest era of humanity or something out of our greatest nightmare.

Plus packaged translations should be tested as well. In some cases upstream manages the workflow and in another may it be managed for downstream only. In total a sync between upstream, translation platform and build system seem missing. Which actually results in delay or poor localized interfaces. Transtats is an attempt to fill this gap. It answers some of the questions like (1) Translation status of packages at all three places (2) Translation workload estimation for coming release (3) Translation coverage of a list of packages in a set of languages for a given release.

Even more so when we consider the eCommerce industry. In every corner of the world, eCommerce companies are vying to capture the market share. As a result, companies are required to provide processes and infrastructure to allow data access to Business Intelligence and Development teams without compromising on regulatory requirements. To solve this problem, there is some commercially available software which encrypts data at rest by using key management within or outside the RDBMS. But we have been able to solve this problem innovatively by using triggers and a set of Python scripts which is free, masks data in real time, has simple to configure columns for masking and retains the usability of data after masking. We have developed a set of functions for each type of sensitive data that is used in various applications most commonly.

It took us years to develop approaches and processes to scale projects and we are constantly reviewing and working hard on improving ourselves. So, what is next?</p><p>What do we want to do next, what do we want to do better and how do we want to help more people, train developers, create better software and hardware and do good?</p><p>We came up with three areas, that we want to focus on:</p><p>1. In 2018, it is our goal to improve the quality of work of the FOSSASIA organization and contributions in our projects. We believe that the way to move forward is to provide project owners with more responsibilities and ownership. We aim to develop more and more into an organization that provides a framework for projects. Therefore we will continue to develop programs like Codeheat, OpenTechNights, organize meetups, participate in GSoC and GCI. We also plan to cooperate more with other organizations. Why shouldn't we run the OpenTechNights at events around the world and help to bring people together? Why shouldn't we have more OpenTechSummits with partners in China, India and Vietnam?</p><p>2. We have made very good experience with our best practices. We have seen that newcomers can progress very fast if they feel welcome and receive help and guidance from others. After they become participants in our programs many contributors move on to support others as mentors. We also see that contributors have moved to large companies, but still continue to help others in the community. This is wonderful. We want to share our experience and inspire other projects. Therefore, we plan to participate in more events, we will set up a monthly live-cast and we will run a YouTube series on these topics. While a lot of traditional school education still encourages a top-down approach we will focus our attention even more on enabling the community to collaborate on an equal level and follow the idea of sharing ideas and code freely.</p><p>3. A question that any organization and project encounters over time is how to ensure the work and setup is sustainable? What settings do projects need to succeed? While there are many non-profit organizations out there developing Open Technologies and FOSS, we also see that many people are moving on to companies that often focus on proprietary solutions and prevent contributors from continuing their engagement in the Open Tech community due to financial reasons and to support their families. At the same time, we see many projects that would have a great potential to be Open Source and at the same time commercially successful. Therefore we are starting a new dedicated FOSSASIA Accelerator that is specifically for Open Source projects. We invite projects to apply for the accelerator and investors and companies to team up with us. And, think about it, while many startups these days start with an idea, Open Source startups already have a product before any investment has started. So, these are great opportunities!</p><p>The problems in this world are too big. There is a lot of injustice, we are destroying the environment and people are even fighting each others. At FOSSASIA we want to set an example of collaboration across borders and cultures. So, please join us and let's make this a success. I wish everyone a wonderful event full of sharing and new understandings. Let's get inspired to share and learn for each other to build a better world.</p>","signup-url":null,"starts-at":"2018-03-22T15:05:00+00:00","average-rating":null,"language":null,"video-url":"https://youtu.be/5U0SlcRkHM4","slides-url":null,"is-mail-sent":false,"title":"How FOSSASIA Scales Up and What Comes Next","comments":"","is-locked":false,"id":"4253","track":{"name":"Open Data, Internet Society, Community","description":null,"deleted-at":null,"font-color":"#ffffff","color":"#0050eb","id":"708"},"microlocation":{"name":"Lecture Theatre","floor":2,"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"deleted-at":null,"room":null,"id":"512"},"session-type":{"name":"Keynote","deleted-at":null,"length":"00:25","id":"384"},"speakers":[{"email":"office@fossasia.org","speaking-experience":null,"complex-field-values":null,"heard-from":null,"city":"Singapore","position":"Founder","short-biography":"<span><p style=\"\">Hong Phuc, originally from Vietnam, lives in  between the US, Singapore and Berlin.

Especially when you have to cater to umpteen users using umpteen different OSs and ecosystems. Users may have very old version of a specific library that they are not ready to upgrade because some legacy application still depends on that. Or they have a latest version of a Ruby gem with which your application will not work, yet. All this can cause a bad experience for the users, and hence never ending flow of bug reports for developers. All of this in addition to the trouble it takes to properly document what all dependencies your software depends on, what order they has to be installed, to which all locations and what files should have what permission etc etc.With full stack installers, you no longer have that problem. You provide a batteries included package to the users, which they can install using the OS package managers that they are familiar with. It basically includes whatever bells and whistles your software need to work - without users even having to look under the hood.Omnibus is a full stack installer creator from Chef, the developers of automation solutions (Hence the food/kitchen reference in talk title. :D ). It lets you create installers/packages of your application for common OSs - Debian, Ubuntu, RedHat, CentOS, Mac OS, Windows etc. In this talk, I cover the basic concepts of full stack installers, their pros and cons and then a quick dive into the working of omnibus along with a basic idea of Chef.

It is easy to forget that neither of these models was obvious at the dawn of computing; they both had to be invented, and they're not the only ways to do it. The good news is that developing F/OSS is not intrinsically incompatible with making a living, people have been doing it for decades.

Meng programs in Perl and Javascript, and is now learning Prolog, Clojure, and Haskell.</p>","instagram":null,"deleted-at":null,"is-email-overridden":false,"sponsorship-required":null,"organisation":"Legalese.com","twitter":"https://twitter.com/mengwong","name":"Meng Weng Wong","long-biography":null,"mobile":"N/A","gender":"Male","country":"Singapore","is-featured":null,"website":"http://mengwong.com","thumbnail-image-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/275/speakers/3390/thumbnail/RzNEZzIxd1/106db0e9-03e1-4f0f-a75a-dfb6bb966a3d.jpg","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/mengwong","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mengwong","small-image-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/275/speakers/3390/small/ZTlqTkxQY1/036ffa47-8532-42d4-9e43-8dfbbd29be64.jpg","github":"https://github.com/mengwong","icon-image-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/275/speakers/3390/icon/OThsUGVUWF/0b104cc7-bceb-4de8-bada-09c6fcf18adb.jpg","photo-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/275/speakers/3390/photo/d1lSWFNKZE/73b5286c-788f-4de2-b3b6-a2acbdb28a35.png","id":"3390"}],"links":{"self":"/v1/events/b548bcfc/sessions?include=track%2Cmicrolocation%2Csession-type%2Cspeakers&page%5Bsize%5D=0"}},{"complex-field-values":null,"long-abstract":null,"last-modified-at":"2020-04-25T08:38:41.175403+00:00","deleted-at":null,"created-at":"2018-01-04T19:29:20.345539+00:00","subtitle":null,"audio-url":null,"ends-at":"2018-03-24T10:25:00+00:00","level":null,"submitted-at":"2018-01-21T11:13:58.748000+00:00","state":"confirmed","short-abstract":"<p>Learn more about how the open event project uses JSON API, a specification for building APIs.

Programmers can use any of three kinds of languages to develop applications: C/C++, Java and HTML/JS. Elastos is different from an Android-like OS in at least four aspects:1. Elastos has a complete set of novel C/C++ APIs and frameworks, which correspond to the Java APIs and frameworks of Android. With better performance and a smaller footprint, Elastos is a better fit for embedded systems and machines with wireless peripherals. Elastos also supports almost all Android Java and JS APIs and frameworks. POSIX APIs are deprecated.2. Elastos has a distributed OS runtime to guarantee end-to-end security and integrity across the Internet. With built-in metadata-driven reflection technology, Elastos can automatically generate code to bridge programming modules across languages and machine boundaries. In other words, applications, services and IoT devices are prohibited from sending/receiving network packets directly, in order to fence off network attacks initiated from third party software and hardware.3. Elastos runtime has a pioneering, service-oriented architecture, designed ideally for containers/virtual-machines. An Elastos runtime can be thought of as a CppVM (vs. JavaVM) without a leaking bottom, i.e., there are no Java-Native-Interface (JNI) equivalent mechanisms to expose the underlying physical machine or host OS. This prevents the possibility of malicious code penetrating into the system layer.4. Elastos is decentralized across the Internet, and utilizes blockchains to authenticate user IDs, application IDs, as well as machine IDs. To build a flourishing ecosystem, anybody may freely implement their own markets, social apps, search engines, location-based services, advertisement agents, and so on, while being rewarded with Elastos coins. </p>","is-locked":false,"id":"4425","track":{"name":"Blockchain","description":null,"deleted-at":null,"font-color":"#000000","color":"#f0bc03","id":"897"},"microlocation":{"name":"Event Hall 2-1","floor":2,"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"deleted-at":null,"room":null,"id":"513"},"session-type":{"name":"Talk","deleted-at":null,"length":"00:25","id":"380"},"speakers":[{"email":"martin+eventyay@realss.com","speaking-experience":"<p>I have been speaking at previous FOSSASIA conferences, as well as various other conferences and events.</p>","complex-field-values":null,"heard-from":null,"city":"beijing","position":"Community Manager","short-biography":"<p>Martin has been using Free Software for more than 20 years.

It is called synthetic because it is not operated by any state or even has\nany tangible value rather it seems to be a new asset that is trade-able resulting\nfrom an agreement between two individuals secretly and it is facilitated with\nthe help of internet technology. Included in this synthetic currency is Bit\ncoin (BTC) that has proved to be one of the most important one. BTC can be stated as “Digital money is simply the idea that, thanks to technology, money can\nnow be a digital object, a unique serial number that can be directly exchanged\nanonymously and without accounting, just as one person would hand a dollar bill\nto another person, you had it, now they have it, Very simple”. There is already\na lot of usage of digital money, for example when a person makes a transaction\nthe system identifies the person and makes credit equivalent to the amount of\ndeposit, which makes it digitally usable on ATM machines or in transfer from\nperson to person or can be utilized to purchase goods or services. But this is\nnot related to concept of digital currencies because a digital currency is more\nlike a real form of currency with a characteristic of independence i.e. free\nfrom intermediaries such as central banks. Hence the whole system of digital\ncurrency is decentralized and there is no decision making involved by\npoliticians or governments or banks. Such as Bit coins work through\ncryptographic algorithms to make the currency digitally usable.
