This work was done during a research internship at CSIR-National Institute of Oceanography. We worked with datasets provided by the field work and underwater explorations in the Arabian Sea along Western Coast of India. In this project, the traditional image restoration approach is extended by incorporating underwater optical properties into the system response function. Underwater turbidity causes loss of clarity transparency, visibility and the luminosity in underwater images to study a particular scene for Marine Archeologists. In this project, we have implemented and compared different methods of underwater image enhancement and restoration which are degraded by the turbidity in water. We implemented the various image processing algorithms considering an average quality camera (i.e., Logitech C920). The algorithms implemented in a step-wise manner are preprocessing, filtering, enhancement and denoising based on a model. Images tend to get degraded as the depth and turbidity increases, the amount of light on objects decreases and light distribution becomes nonuniform. To tackle this issue, the input images are converted to YCbCr color space and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) is performed on the Luminescence(Y) channel of the image which improves the local contrast, at the same time limiting the amplification which can over-amplify the noise too. The filtering and enhancement were done using the Bilateral Filter and then finally the enhancement was carried out using the wavelet denoising method and de-blurring. Due to the intensity variations involved in underwater sensing, denoising is carefully carried out by wavelet decompositions. This is necessary to explore different effects of restoration constraints, and especially their response to an underwater environment where the effects of scattering can be easily treated as either signal or noise.</p><p>Since our solution aided the marine archeologists in their studies, we gave more emphasis to the information extraction and the visibility of features rather than the enhancing the physical features of the underwater images.</p>","signup-url":null,"starts-at":"2018-03-25T13:30:00+00:00","average-rating":null,"language":null,"video-url":"https://youtube.com/watch?v=LbWDTnI_3Do&list=PLzZVLecTsGpKb1P8J5WLrONMLby5Dn1EV&index=185&t=0s","slides-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/temp/4449dc67-323b-4d1a-a6e0-48a26f221244/OWdYMGJveU/FossAsia18_Proposal.pptx","is-mail-sent":false,"title":"Reducing the effect of turbidity in underwater images","comments":"<p>This proposal is our joint work - Mr. Himanshu Singh and myself.

GPU computing provides the opportunity to parallelize data parallel algorithms while CPU can run the sequential code.

To give an example, computation on multiple CPU nodes, GPU nodes can all occur in parallel and can be synchronized when the results are required by the user.

Compared to proprietary softwares used for communication, Free RTC uses open standards making voice and video chat communication truly secure. Specifically, Lumicall (<a href=\"http://lumicall.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">lumicall.org</a>) is a tool which makes phone calls over the internet, free of charge and with end-to-end encryption, so there is no man-in-the-middle. Compared to other free software solutions like Ring or Jitsi: it uses SIP, Session Initiation Protocol. Now SIP has great advantages over other protocols used in telephony, for example it’s Interoperability with many other telephony solutions. Using free software for real time communication makes it possible to make and receive calls from people who choose only to use genuinely free software &amp; open standards preserving the credible standard of privacy. This choice to choose free and secure software over proprietary software is hard but essential at this point of time where almost everyday new softwares are coming up to achieve communication.</span></p><p><span style=\"\"></span></p><p><span style=\"\">Both us as students have been part of Google Summer of Code and Outreachy program with Debian.

To solve this problem, there is some commercially available software which encrypts data at rest by using key management within or outside the RDBMS. But we have been able to solve this problem innovatively by using triggers and a set of Python scripts which is free, masks data in real time, has simple to configure columns for masking and retains the usability of data after masking.

However, a few simple concepts can simplify this problem. The main challenge, as mentioned, with collaborative editing is the concurrency control [<strong>concurrent edits</strong>] to the document are not commutative. This needs to be causally ordered before applying either by undoing history or by transforming the operations [<strong>operational transformation</strong>] before applying them to make them seem commutative.</p><p></p>Bringing Latency into action<p></p><p>Introducing latency between the client and server is where the problems arise. Latency in a <span>collaborative</span> editor introduces the possibility of version conflicts. Here, where, I said Operational Transformation will come into action.</p><p></p><p>Let’s take an example :</p><p></p><p><strong>Starting Client’s state :</strong></p><p></p><p>ABCD</p><p></p><p><strong>Starting Server’s state :</strong></p><p></p><p>ABCD</p><p></p><p>Now, let’s say, <em>Client</em> enters X in between C and D , the operation would look something like this :</p><p></p><p>insert(X,3) //where 3 is the position where x is going to be added (0=A, 1=B, 2=C ..)</p><p></p><p>And at the same time, <em>Server</em> deletes,b the operation would be :</p><p></p><p>delete(B,1)</p><p></p><p>What actually should happen is that the client and server should both end with ACXD but in reality, <em>client</em> ends with ACXD</p><p></p>Starting Document State -&gt; ABCD\"Insert 'X'\" operation at offset 3 [local] -&gt; ABCXD\"Delete 'B'\" operation at offset 1 [remote] -&gt; ACXD<p></p><p>but the <em>server</em> ends with acdx.</p><p></p>Starting Document State -&gt; ABCD\"Delete 'B'\" operation at offset 1 [local] -&gt; ACD\"Insert 'X'\" operation at offset 3 [remote] -&gt; ACDX<p></p><p>Of course, ACXD != ACDX and the document which is shared now is in the wrong state.</p><p></p><p>Here is where the <strong>Operational Transformation</strong> algorithm comes to the rescue.</p><p></p>Operational Transformation Algorithm<p></p><p>Operational Transformation (OT) is an algorithm/technique for the transformation of operations such that they can be applied to documents whose states have diverged, bringing them both back to the same state.</p><p></p>How does Operational Transformation work?<p></p><p>A short overview of how OT works :</p><p></p><ul><li>Every change (insertion or deletion) is represented as an <strong>operation</strong>. An operation can be applied to the current document which results into a new document state.</li><li>To handle concurrent operations, we use the <strong>tranform</strong> function that takes two operations that have been applied to the same document state (but on different clients) and computes a new operation that can be applied after the second operation and that preserves the first operation’s intended change.</li></ul><p></p><p>Let’s apply Operational Transformation in the original example.</p><p></p><p>If we apply OT, <em>Client</em> will see :</p><p></p>Starting Document State -&gt; ABCD\"Insert 'X'\" operation at offset 3 [local] -&gt; ABCXD\"Delete 'B'\" operation at offset 1 [transformed] -&gt; ACXD<p></p><p>and <em>Server</em> will see :</p><p></p>Starting Document State -&gt; ABCD\"Delete 'B'\" operation at offset 1 [local] -&gt; ACD\"Insert 'X'\" operation at offset 2 [transformed] -&gt; ACXD //Transform function would add add it in the new (3 - 1 = 2) position<p></p>Client — Server [OT] Approach to Collaborative Editing<p>The <strong>transform</strong> function is used to build a client-server protocol that can handle collaboration between any number of clients.</p><p>Choosing a Client-Server architecture will allow scouting a large number of clients without actually complicating the environment. Also, there will be a single system which holds the source of truth i.e. the server, so even if the clients crash/go offline for a long time, we can go back to the server and fetch the document easily.</p><p>This source of truth also forces the client to wait for the server to <strong>acknowledge</strong> the operation that the client has just sent which would mean that the client always stays on the server’s OT path. This would help in keeping a single history of operations without actually having to keep a mirror of the state for each client that is connected. That would eventually mean the number of clients that are connected to the server would have only one single copy of the document on the server.</p><p></p>Conclusion<p></p><p><strong>Operational Transformation</strong>\n is a very powerful tool that allows to build great collaborative apps \nwith support for non-blocking concurrent editing. I am looking forward \nto dive deep into the algorithm (and ofcourse extending this blogpost) \nand possibly working on an editor which supports it as well.</p><p></p>","signup-url":null,"starts-at":"2018-03-25T14:30:00+00:00","average-rating":null,"language":null,"video-url":null,"slides-url":null,"is-mail-sent":false,"title":"Building a real-time collaborative editor using OT","comments":null,"is-locked":false,"id":"4508"},{"complex-field-values":null,"long-abstract":null,"last-modified-at":"2018-01-21T23:40:11.982200+00:00","deleted-at":null,"created-at":"2017-12-20T05:43:45.950894+00:00","subtitle":null,"audio-url":null,"ends-at":"2018-03-22T13:00:00+00:00","level":null,"submitted-at":"2018-01-21T23:40:11.982200+00:00","state":"rejected","short-abstract":"<p>mHealth using mobile data collection and reporting, decision making from end worker.</p>","signup-url":null,"starts-at":"2018-03-22T12:00:00+00:00","average-rating":null,"language":null,"video-url":null,"slides-url":null,"is-mail-sent":false,"title":"mHealth","comments":null,"is-locked":false,"id":"4423"},{"complex-field-values":null,"long-abstract":null,"last-modified-at":"2018-01-12T18:13:26.870238+00:00","deleted-at":null,"created-at":"2017-12-09T15:50:00.388533+00:00","subtitle":null,"audio-url":null,"ends-at":"2018-03-22T13:00:00+00:00","level":null,"submitted-at":"2018-01-12T18:13:26.870238+00:00","state":"rejected","short-abstract":"<p>Frontend Frameworks are really important, but knowing the insights of a framework help you to design your own framework.</p><p>In the presentation, we will deal with the Internals of Angular and learn how can we make our frontend applications faster.</p><p>The presentation will directly dive in into the magical algorithm which Angular follows in Change Detection.</p>","signup-url":null,"starts-at":"2018-03-22T12:00:00+00:00","average-rating":null,"language":null,"video-url":null,"slides-url":"https://aayusharora.github.io/PPT/","is-mail-sent":false,"title":"Change Detection In Angular","comments":null,"is-locked":false,"id":"4371"},{"complex-field-values":null,"long-abstract":null,"last-modified-at":"2018-01-21T23:40:20.563540+00:00","deleted-at":null,"created-at":"2017-12-13T14:29:32.900164+00:00","subtitle":null,"audio-url":null,"ends-at":"2018-03-22T13:00:00+00:00","level":null,"submitted-at":"2018-01-21T23:40:20.563540+00:00","state":"rejected","short-abstract":"<p><span style=\"\">Eddystone is a protocol specification, an open beacon format from Google, that defines a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) message format for proximity beacon messages.

These commands will have an effect. Functional languages like Haskell, OCaml revolve around the concept of 'pure functions'. A pure function is expressed as a mathematical expression only. You can evaluate the expression and there will be no side effects, for example, no I/O operations, no global state changes, no database interactions. The output is only dependent on its inputs. Hence, it is based on ‘equational reasoning’. So if you were to call a pure function with the same inputs a million times, you would get the same result every single time. Since there are no side effects, there is immutable data.</p><p>The data once initialized remains same throughout the lifetime of the code, which makes 'parallel programming' easier. Due to this immutability of data, the value of an expression is the same anywhere it might occur in the program – as long as the required variables are defined. This is termed as 'Referential Transparency'. It means that the value of an expression is the same anywhere it might occur in the program – as long as the required variables are defined. You never need to track the value of state variables or remember any updates. This enables usage of 'memoization' – you basically ‘remember’ the outputs of expensive functions with some common arguments in a sort of lookup table. This reduces the computational complexity at the expense of memory.</p><p>Functions are dealt as 'first-class citizens', i.e, you can treat them as any other objects – you can assign them to variables, you can pass them as arguments, or even get them returned from other functions. 'Recursion' is the most important aspect of functional programming, since there are no loops (which prevents any side effects). 'Higher order functions' like map(), reduce() and filter() can take functions as arguments (or return them as results), providing parallelism over sequences. Partial function application, 'currying' and 'lazy evaluation' prevents loading entire data at once into the memory. All these features provide the advantage of code re-usability, less bugs, easy testing and parallelism. </p><p>This talk will acquaint the audience with functional programming features and why is it a hot topic today.</p><p>Last 5 minutes would be left for any questions.</p>","signup-url":null,"starts-at":"2018-03-24T13:30:00+00:00","average-rating":null,"language":null,"video-url":null,"slides-url":null,"is-mail-sent":false,"title":"Thinking functionally: Introduction to Functional Programming Paradigm","comments":null,"is-locked":false,"id":"4473"},{"complex-field-values":null,"long-abstract":null,"last-modified-at":"2018-01-11T16:00:12.729715+00:00","deleted-at":null,"created-at":"2017-12-25T15:08:59.860619+00:00","subtitle":null,"audio-url":null,"ends-at":"2018-03-22T13:00:00+00:00","level":null,"submitted-at":"2018-01-11T16:00:12.729715+00:00","state":"rejected","short-abstract":"<p>The Eventyay is an app that's really useful for creating and organising events.

What do you do when you have a systems team of 10 devs and a company of more than 250 devs (and growing)?  Automate every task in an extensible and scalable way. At Go-Jek, we were seeing requests being raised at rates of more than 15 adhoc tasks per week. We decided to bring it down to less than 3 per week.The requests received by systems team belonged to 7 broad categories. For instance, requests included tasks like setting up services, increasing disk size, fixing master-slave db replication, etc. Most tasks can be handled by users themselves. Hence we decided to build `Proctor` to help us automate repetitive and manual tasks.We had 3 requirements:- Users should be able to automate any job (in any language of their preference)- Handle requests of running a job in a sandbox environment and report its status- Have a simple and documented interface to run a jobThe design we took ended up with 3 components independent of each other. The components are as follows:1. `Automation scripts reservoir`- A user adds a script( in any language, having any dependency)- Review every script by security- Package script and dependencies into an image during CI; and push it to internal artifactory2. `Service to handle jobs`- A web service which handles submission and reporting of jobs- Authorization is handled by this service- This service runs jobs in relevant kubernetes cluster- All configuration and secrets required by a job (inside packaged image) are managed by this service3. `Client to run jobs`- A client (CLI tool) to run jobs using the web service- All parameters required by the job are managed by the clientAs an end result, users can automate any task, manage its configuration in the server and run it using the client.This talk will revolve around how the design of `Proctor` evolved over time with feedback from users; challenges faced; what impact it had on Go-Jek; and the future of `Proctor` (hint: we're open sourcing it soon).</p>","is-locked":false,"id":"4397"},{"complex-field-values":null,"long-abstract":null,"last-modified-at":"2018-02-17T01:46:53.984829+00:00","deleted-at":null,"created-at":"2017-12-08T04:49:13.886442+00:00","subtitle":null,"audio-url":null,"ends-at":"2018-03-22T13:00:00+00:00","level":null,"submitted-at":"2018-02-17T01:46:53.984829+00:00","state":"rejected","short-abstract":"<p><span style=\"\">This talk explains the concept of Kappa and Lambda architectures and showcases how useful business knowledge can be extracted from the flowing river of data.

Especially when you have to cater to umpteen users using umpteen different OSs and ecosystems. Users may have very old version of a specific library that they are not ready to upgrade because some legacy application still depends on that. Or they have a latest version of a Ruby gem with which your application will not work, yet. All this can cause a bad experience for the users, and hence never ending flow of bug reports for developers. All of this in addition to the trouble it takes to properly document what all dependencies your software depends on, what order they has to be installed, to which all locations and what files should have what permission etc etc.With full stack installers, you no longer have that problem. You provide a batteries included package to the users, which they can install using the OS package managers that they are familiar with. It basically includes whatever bells and whistles your software need to work - without users even having to look under the hood.Omnibus is a full stack installer creator from Chef, the developers of automation solutions (Hence the food/kitchen reference in talk title. :D ).

Interns are paid a stipend of $5,500 and have a $500 travel stipend available to them.

LDAP is a standard application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an Internet Protocol (IP) network. I am helping Fedora improve the Directory Servers Python command line tools. In addition to this, the team at Fedora is also investigating into integrating existing C code with Rust (watch here: </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: underline;\">Integrating Rust with existing C</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\">) to improve performance and maintainability.

My first task was to add the command line support for automember plugin to the Directory Server. Automembership allows a static group to act like a dynamic group, for adding new members to the group. Different automembership definitions create searches that are automatically run on all new directory entries. The automembership rules search for and identify matching entries and then explicitly add those entries as members to the group. I started by added the classes (Auto Membership Plugin, Auto Member Definition, Auto Member Definitions), methods and the tests for these classes and methods (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: underline;\">Pull Request</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\">). Then I added the support for automember by command line which included creating, removing, editing and showing the automember definitions. This included writing the tests as well. By the end of this task, I learnt about Python decorators, lazy evaluation in Python, using pytest testing tool and writing command line parser and arguments using the argparse library. (This will be shown with live coding and screenshots).</span></p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\"></span></p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\">I am currently working on another task which involves building an LRU cache in Rust which stores C allocated strings and can retrieve them. This project will be built using the meson build system. I will also provide tests and asan builds. This task will act as a proof of concept for investigating if meson can replace autotools as the Directory Server build system. During this task, I hope to learn about build systems, LRU caching concept and Rust types and safety.</span></p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\"></span></p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\">As you can deduce from my tasks and the key learnings, doing this Outreachy internship with Fedora is helping me to stand at the forefront of technology, learning about LDAP, Python and Rust (polyglot!), which will definitely enable me to become a better programmer and a collaborative community member for Fedora. I hope to inspire other underrepresented people in tech with my talk about the Outreachy internship and my

It took us years to develop approaches and processes to scale projects and we are constantly reviewing and working hard on improving ourselves. So, what is next?</p><p>What do we want to do next, what do we want to do better and how do we want to help more people, train developers, create better software and hardware and do good?</p><p>We came up with three areas, that we want to focus on:</p><p>1. In 2018, it is our goal to improve the quality of work of the FOSSASIA organization and contributions in our projects. We believe that the way to move forward is to provide project owners with more responsibilities and ownership. We aim to develop more and more into an organization that provides a framework for projects. Therefore we will continue to develop programs like Codeheat, OpenTechNights, organize meetups, participate in GSoC and GCI. We also plan to cooperate more with other organizations. Why shouldn't we run the OpenTechNights at events around the world and help to bring people together? Why shouldn't we have more OpenTechSummits with partners in China, India and Vietnam?</p><p>2. We have made very good experience with our best practices. We have seen that newcomers can progress very fast if they feel welcome and receive help and guidance from others. After they become participants in our programs many contributors move on to support others as mentors. We also see that contributors have moved to large companies, but still continue to help others in the community. This is wonderful. We want to share our experience and inspire other projects. Therefore, we plan to participate in more events, we will set up a monthly live-cast and we will run a YouTube series on these topics. While a lot of traditional school education still encourages a top-down approach we will focus our attention even more on enabling the community to collaborate on an equal level and follow the idea of sharing ideas and code freely.</p><p>3. A question that any organization and project encounters over time is how to ensure the work and setup is sustainable? What settings do projects need to succeed? While there are many non-profit organizations out there developing Open Technologies and FOSS, we also see that many people are moving on to companies that often focus on proprietary solutions and prevent contributors from continuing their engagement in the Open Tech community due to financial reasons and to support their families. At the same time, we see many projects that would have a great potential to be Open Source and at the same time commercially successful. Therefore we are starting a new dedicated FOSSASIA Accelerator that is specifically for Open Source projects. We invite projects to apply for the accelerator and investors and companies to team up with us. And, think about it, while many startups these days start with an idea, Open Source startups already have a product before any investment has started. So, these are great opportunities!</p><p>The problems in this world are too big. There is a lot of injustice, we are destroying the environment and people are even fighting each others. At FOSSASIA we want to set an example of collaboration across borders and cultures. So, please join us and let's make this a success. I wish everyone a wonderful event full of sharing and new understandings. Let's get inspired to share and learn for each other to build a better world.</p>","signup-url":null,"starts-at":"2018-03-22T15:05:00+00:00","average-rating":null,"language":null,"video-url":"https://youtu.be/5U0SlcRkHM4","slides-url":null,"is-mail-sent":false,"title":"How FOSSASIA Scales Up and What Comes Next","comments":"","is-locked":false,"id":"4253"},{"complex-field-values":null,"long-abstract":null,"last-modified-at":"2020-04-19T10:40:20.695828+00:00","deleted-at":null,"created-at":"2018-03-09T10:56:31.569700+00:00","subtitle":null,"audio-url":null,"ends-at":"2018-03-25T13:30:00+00:00","level":null,"submitted-at":"2018-03-21T10:31:13.913000+00:00","state":"accepted","short-abstract":"<p>Lightning talk sessions are taking place on Saturday/Day 3 and Sunday/Day 4 of the event.

Programmers can use any of three kinds of languages to develop applications: C/C++, Java and HTML/JS. Elastos is different from an Android-like OS in at least four aspects:1. Elastos has a complete set of novel C/C++ APIs and frameworks, which correspond to the Java APIs and frameworks of Android. With better performance and a smaller footprint, Elastos is a better fit for embedded systems and machines with wireless peripherals. Elastos also supports almost all Android Java and JS APIs and frameworks. POSIX APIs are deprecated.2. Elastos has a distributed OS runtime to guarantee end-to-end security and integrity across the Internet. With built-in metadata-driven reflection technology, Elastos can automatically generate code to bridge programming modules across languages and machine boundaries. In other words, applications, services and IoT devices are prohibited from sending/receiving network packets directly, in order to fence off network attacks initiated from third party software and hardware.3. Elastos runtime has a pioneering, service-oriented architecture, designed ideally for containers/virtual-machines. An Elastos runtime can be thought of as a CppVM (vs. JavaVM) without a leaking bottom, i.e., there are no Java-Native-Interface (JNI) equivalent mechanisms to expose the underlying physical machine or host OS. This prevents the possibility of malicious code penetrating into the system layer.4.

It is called synthetic because it is not operated by any state or even has\nany tangible value rather it seems to be a new asset that is trade-able resulting\nfrom an agreement between two individuals secretly and it is facilitated with\nthe help of internet technology. Included in this synthetic currency is Bit\ncoin (BTC) that has proved to be one of the most important one. BTC can be stated as “Digital money is simply the idea that, thanks to technology, money can\nnow be a digital object, a unique serial number that can be directly exchanged\nanonymously and without accounting, just as one person would hand a dollar bill\nto another person, you had it, now they have it, Very simple”. There is already\na lot of usage of digital money, for example when a person makes a transaction\nthe system identifies the person and makes credit equivalent to the amount of\ndeposit, which makes it digitally usable on ATM machines or in transfer from\nperson to person or can be utilized to purchase goods or services. But this is\nnot related to concept of digital currencies because a digital currency is more\nlike a real form of currency with a characteristic of independence i.e. free\nfrom intermediaries such as central banks. Hence the whole system of digital\ncurrency is decentralized and there is no decision making involved by\npoliticians or governments or banks. Such as Bit coins work through\ncryptographic algorithms to make the currency digitally usable. There are people who like the idea of currency which does\nnot involve people in grey suits i.e. bankers and politicians who have had the\nsystem under control until now.

In this talk, I would like to share with the audience the design of a smart home based entirely on open-source platforms. I will start with the hardware that I have designed to overcome some of the limitations of commercially available devices. Next, I will cover the integration of my hardware devices with the server system which is based on the open-source Home Assistant project. Lastly, I will talk about the configuration of a voice-based personal assistant based on the open-source <a href=\"http://Mycroft.AI\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Mycroft.AI</a> software and the widely-known Raspberry Pi hardware kit. Through this talk, I want to share my knowledge and I hope to enable more people to start making great things in Singapore, and across the world.","signup-url":null,"starts-at":null,"average-rating":null,"language":null,"video-url":"https://youtu.be/33DfnsX9g6s","slides-url":null,"is-mail-sent":false,"title":"Our Smart Home - from Dream to Reality","comments":"","is-locked":false,"id":"6224"},{"complex-field-values":null,"long-abstract":null,"last-modified-at":"2020-04-21T05:30:00.124711+00:00","deleted-at":null,"created-at":"2020-04-20T11:19:09.210042+00:00","subtitle":null,"audio-url":null,"ends-at":null,"level":null,"submitted-at":"2020-04-20T11:19:08.755000+00:00","state":"rejected","short-abstract":"<p>Google Deepmind made history with AlphaGo beating the best Go player in the world, igniting the imagination of many scientists, researchers, and hobbyists by releasing papers outlining their solution. In this talk, I want to showcase how we can make use of the same techniques employed by AlphaGo to solve games on OpenAI Gym. The beauty of games is that we can visually inspect the output as the AI agent plays it - we will step through the logic of deep reinforcement learning, the “train of thoughts” of the AI agent and how we can code all these up in Tensorflow and Python with just our laptop or a small cloud cluster.</p><p>Why now? Well, AI used to be a privilege of the rich, crazy or both. Thankfully, we now have the maturity of open source technologies, availability of data science knowledge and affordable hardware for hobbyists like us to craft our own AI agents. An understanding of AI is necessary because what’s next is either the beginning of the greatest era of humanity or something out of our greatest nightmare. As geeks, we have the opportunity and responsibility to shape the development of AI, to make it accessible and beneficial to all our future generations.
